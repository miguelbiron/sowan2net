`sowan2net` : Inference on Network Edge Weights from Sums of Weights At the Nodes

The purpose of this package is to find weighted adjacency matrices of a network (or graph) that match data on the sums of the weights at each node. Since this is an underdetermined problem, the main function is built to explore the solution space randomly.

ToDo

- Vignette with detailed exposition of the methodology
